          <stage>A street in the Judengasse, outside the Synagogue. During this Scene Jews and Jewesses, singly and in groups, with prayer-books in their hands, pass across the stage, and go into the Synagogue. Among them, enter BARUCH and NAPHTALI.</stage>

            <l>Nay; Rabbi Jacob's door</l>
            <l>Swung to behind him, just as I puffed up</l>
            <l>O'erblown with haste. See how our years weigh, cousin.</l>
            <l>Who'd judge me with this paunch a temperate man,</l>
            <l>A man of modest means, a man withal</l>
            <l>Scarce overpast his prime? Well, God be praised,</l>
            <l>If age bring no worse burden ! Who is this stranger?</l>
            <l>Simon the Leech tells me he claims to bear</l>
            <l>Some special message from the Lord —no doubt</l>
            <l>To-morrow, fresh from rest, he'll publish it</l>

            <l>Since you denote him so remarkable,</l>

            <l>A blind, old man,</l>
            <l>Mayhap is all you 'll find him — spent with travel,</l>
            <l>His raiment fouled with dust, his sandaled feet</l>
            <l>Road-bruised by stone and bramble. But his face!—</l>
            <l>Majestic with long fall of cloud-white beard,</l>
            <l>And hoary wreath of hair— oh, it is one</l>
            <l>Already kissed by angels.</l>

          <sp who="#baruch">
            <speaker>BARUCH.</speaker>
            <l>Look, there limps</l>
            <l>Little Manasseh, bloated as his purse,</l>
            <l>And wrinkled as a frost-pinched fruit. I hear</l>
            <l>His last loan to the Syndic will result</l>
            <l>In quadrupling his wealth. Good Lord! what luck</l>
            <l>Blesses some folk, while good men stint and sweat</l>
            <l>And scrape, to merely fill the household larder.</l>
            <l>What said you of this pilgrim, Naphtali?</l>
            <l>These inequalities of fortune rub</l>
            <l>My sense of justice so against the grain,</l>
            <l>I lose my very name. Whence does he come?</l>
            <l>Is he alone?</l>

            <l>Rabbi Cresselin he calls himself — alone</l>
            <l>Save for his daughter who has led him hither.</l>

            <l>I know not— but I learn from other source</l>
            <l>It has burst forth at Erfurt.</l>

            <l>No.</l>
            <l>They cleanse their homes and keep their bodies sweet,</l>
            <l>Nor cease from prayer— and so does Jacob's God</l>
            <l>Protect His chosen, still. Yet even His favor</l>
            <l>Our enemies would twist into a curse.</l>
            <l>Beholding the destroying angel smite</l>
            <l>The foal idolater and leave unscathed</l>
            <l>The gates of Israel — the old cry they raise —</l>
            <l>We have begotten the Black Death— we poison</l>
            <l>The well-springs of the towns.</l>

            <l>God pity us!</l>
            <l>But truly are we blessed in Nordhausen.</l>
            <l>Such terrors seem remote as Egypt's plagues.</l>
            <l>I warrant you our Landgrave dare not harry</l>
            <l>Such creditors as we. See, here comes one,</l>
            <l>The greatest and most liberal of them all—</l>
            <l>Süsskind von Orb.</l>
            <stage>SÜSSKIND VON ORB, LIEBHAID, and REUBEN enter, all pass across the stage, and disappear within the Synagogue.</stage>
            <l>I'd barter my whole fortune,</l>
            <l>And yours to boot, that's thrice the bulk of mine,</l>
            <l>For half the bonds he holds in Frederick's name.</l>
            <l>The richest merchant in Thuringia, he—</l>
            <l>The poise of his head would tell it, knew we not.</l>
            <l>How has his daughter leaped to womanhood!</l>
            <l>I mind when she came toddling by his hand,</l>

            <l>In Savoy, Piedmont, round the garden shores</l>
            <l>Of tranquil Leman, down the beautiful Rhine,</l>
            <l>At Lindau, Costnitz, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen,</l>
            <l>Everywhere torture, smoking Synagogues,</l>
            <l>Carnage, and burning flesh. The lights shine out</l>
            <l>Of Jewish virtue, Jewish truth, to star</l>
            <l>The sanguine field with an immortal blazon.</l>
            <l>The venerable Mar-Isaac in Cologne,</l>
            <l>Sat in his house at prayer, nor lifted lid</l>
            <l>From off the sacred text, while all around</l>
            <l>The fanatics ran riot; him they seized,</l>
            <l>Haled through the streets, with prod of stick and spike</l>
            <l>Fretted his wrinkled flesh, plucked his white beard.</l>
            <l>Dragged him with gibes into their Church, and held</l>
            <l>A Crucifix before him. "Know thy Lord !"</l>
            <l>He spat thereon; he was pulled limb from limb.</l>
            <l>I saw — God, that I might forget ! — a man</l>
            <l>Leap in the Loire, with his fair, stalwart son,</l>
            <l>A-bloom with youth, and midst the stream unsheathe</l>
            <l>A poniard, sheathing it in his boy's heart,</l>
            <l>While he pronounced the blessing for the dead.</l>

            <l>I saw— but no! You are glutted, and my tongue,</l>
            <l>Blistered, refuseth to narrate more woe.</l>
            <l>I have known much sorrow. When it pleased the Lord</l>

            <l>The rabble of armed herdsmen, peasants, slaves,</l>

            <l>Then followed with their scythes, spades, clubs, and banners</l>
            <l>Flaunting the Cross, the hosts of Armleder,</l>
            <l>From whose fierce wounds we scarce are healed to-day.</l>
            <l>Yet do I say the cup of bitterness</l>
            <l>That Israel has drained is but a draught</l>
            <l>Of cordial, to the cup that is prepared.</l>
            <l>The Black Death and the Brothers of the Cross,</l>
            <l>These are our foes — and these are everywhere.</l>

            <l>Ye who have eyes and limbs, arise and flee!</l>
            <l>To-morrow the Flagellants will be here.</l>
            <l>God's angel visited my sleep and spake:</l>

            <p>"I Süsskind von Orb of Nordhausen, swear by the unutterable Name, that on the day when the Castle of Salza was burned, I rescued the infant daughter of Henry Schnetzen from the
            flames. I purposed restoring her to her father, but when I returned to Nordhausen, I found my own child lying on her bier, and my wife in fevered frenzy calling for her babe. I sought the leech, who counselled me to show the Christian child to the bereaved mother as her own. The pious trick prevailed; the fever broke, the mother was restored. But never would she part with the child, even when she had learned to whom it belonged, and until she was gathered with the dead — may peace be with her soul! — she fostered in our Jewish home the offspring of the Gentile knight. Then again would I have yielded the girl to her parent, but Schnetzen was my foe, and I feared the haughty baron would disown the daughter who came from the hands of the Jew. Now however the maiden's temporal happiness demands that she be acknowledged by her rightful father. Let him see what I have written. As a token, behold this golden cross, bound by the Lady Schnetzen round the infant's neck. May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob redeem and bless me as I have writ the truth."</p>

            <p>Lord President and Deputies of the town of Nordhausen! Know that we, Frederick Margrave of Meissen, and Landgrave of Thuringia, command to be burned all the Jews within our territories as far as our lands extend, on account of the great crime they have committed against Christendom in throwing poison into the wells, of
            the truth of which indictment we have absolute knowledge. Therefore we admonish you to have the Jews killed in honor of God, so that Christendom be not enfeebled by them. Whatever responsibility you incur, we will assume with our Lord the Emperor, and with all other lords. Know also that we send to you Henry Schnetzen, our Governor of Salza, who shall publicly accuse your Jews of the above-mentioned crime. Therefore we beseech you to help him to do justice upon them, and we will singularly reward your good will.

            <l>It swells to monstrous bulk. In many towns,</l>
            <l>Folk build high ramparts round the wells and springs.</l>
            <l>In some they shun the treacherous sparkling brooks,</l>
            <l>To drink dull rain-water, or melted snow,</l>
            <l>In mountain districts. Frederick has been patient,</l>
            <l>And too long clement, duped by fleece-cloaked wolves.</l>
            <l>But now his subjects' clamor rouses him</l>
            <l>To front the general peril. As I hear,</l>
            <l>A fiendish and far-reaching plot involves</l>
            <l>All Christian thrones and peoples. These vile vermin,</l>
            <l>Burrowing underneath society,</l>
            <l>Have leagued with Moors in Spain, with heretics</l>
            <l>Too plentiful — Christ knows! in every land,</l>
            <l>And planned a subterraneous, sinuous scheme,</l>
